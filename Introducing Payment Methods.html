    <h1>Introducing Payment Methods</h1>
    <h2>Empowering customers with seamless and convenient payment options</h2>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The project focused on enhancing the payment experience for customers in India in response to the E-Mandate regulations. By implementing immediate solutions and long-term strategies for recurring payments, the initiative aimed to streamline transactions, ensuring compliance while improving customer satisfaction. This comprehensive approach not only saved over $1 million in revenue but also strengthened customer relationships in a key market, demonstrating the importance of adapting to evolving payment landscapes.</p>

        <div class="stat">
            <h3>$1M</h3>
            <p>ARR saved</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stat">
            <h3></h3>
            <p></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>In October 2021, India released the E-Mandate, a digital authorization process that requires individuals to grant businesses permission for recurring payments or direct debits from their bank accounts. This impacts only online merchants that do not have a local presence or tax collecting entity in India such as Dropbox. India was a high-growth market for Dropbox with over $1.5M in recurring payments and there was an urgency to act.</p>

    <h2>Situation</h2>
    <p>The sudden implementation of the law caught online merchants off guard, particularly those with a significant market presence in India. These merchants were taken by surprise when their customers were no longer able to make subscription payments. Within a day, all of our customers experienced rebill failures, and if no action was taken, we would lose our entire customer base within a month.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>As the product manager for the payments & checkout team, my role was to help our customers in India with a viable method and a product that would let them pay for their subscriptions otherwise our customers would have a bad experience and Dropbox would've lost a significant portion of our business there. </p>

    <div class="product">
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>I helped drive the product development process through 3 different stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stop immediate bleeding to prevent customer thrash</li>
            <li>Root cause analysis</li>
            <li>Solutioning to get payments back up and running and figuring out long-term solutions for recurring payments</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Results</h2>
